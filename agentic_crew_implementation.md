# Agentic Crew Implementation

This note provides a high-level system design framework for implementing [[agentic_crew]] using Claude technologies, specifically the [[claude_agent_sdk]]. The architecture enables autonomous crew agents (Director, Writer, DP, Editor, Composer, etc.) to collaborate on film production under human [[orchestrator_role]] coordination.

## Technology Foundation

### Claude Agent SDK as Core Platform

**Why Agent SDK:**

- **Autonomous operation**: Crew agents run independently without constant human input
- **Long-running sessions**: Supports episodic production across multiple sessions
- **Tool integration**: MCP protocol connects agents to production tools (video generation, audio synthesis, rendering)
- **Multi-agent coordination**: Multiple concurrent agent instances with shared production context
- **Persistent memory**: Session-based state management for character and production continuity
- **Production observability**: Sentry integration for monitoring agent collaboration and decisions

**Why NOT Claude Code:**

- Claude Code is for **interactive, human-guided** workflows (IDE assistance, debugging)
- Agentic crew needs **autonomous** operation in production environments
- Claude Code is what the Orchestrator uses to **build** the system, not what runs it

## System Architecture

## Agent Implementation Pattern

### Individual Crew Agent Structure

Each crew agent is a Claude Agent SDK instance with:

**1. Specialized System Prompt:**

```python
# Example: Director Agent
director_options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    system_prompt="""
    You are an autonomous film director for agentic productions.

    Your responsibilities:
    - Shot composition and blocking decisions
    - Performance direction for character agents
    - Scene pacing and emotional tone
    - Visual storytelling through camera and staging

    You collaborate with:
    - DP agent on cinematography
    - Writer agent on script refinement
    - Character agents for performance
    - Editor agent on pacing

    Decision authority:
    - Autonomous: Shot selection within established style, performance adjustments
    - Collaborative: Visual style choices, major scene restructuring
    - Approval-required: Significant narrative changes, budget-impacting decisions

    You work under the Orchestrator's creative vision. Escalate conflicts and
    major decisions to the Orchestrator for final approval.
    """,
    cwd="/production/arcadian_summers",
    session_id="director_s01"  # Persists across episodes
)
```

**2. Role-Specific Tool Access:**

```python
# Director Agent Tools (via MCP)
director_tools = [
    "Read",           # Built-in: Read scripts, storyboards
    "Write",          # Built-in: Write shot lists, notes
    "Storyboard",     # MCP: Generate visual previsualization
    "VideoGeneration",# MCP: Render test shots
    "CharacterQuery", # MCP: Communicate with character agents
    "ScriptDatabase", # MCP: Access production scripts
]

# DP Agent Tools
dp_tools = [
    "Read", "Write",
    "LightingSimulation",  # MCP: Virtual lighting design
    "CameraRig",           # MCP: Camera placement and movement
    "ColorGrading",        # MCP: LUT and grading presets
    "VideoGeneration",     # MCP: Render with cinematography specs
]

# Writer Agent Tools
writer_tools = [
    "Read", "Write",
    "ScriptDatabase",      # MCP: Version-controlled script storage
    "CharacterProfiles",   # MCP: Character memory and continuity
    "DialogueGeneration",  # MCP: LLM-based dialogue refinement
    "StoryStructure",      # MCP: Narrative analysis tools
]

# Character Agent Tools
character_tools = [
    "Read",
    "CharacterMemory",     # MCP: Persistent episodic memory
    "DialogueGeneration",  # MCP: In-character voice generation
    "EmotionalState",      # MCP: Track emotional continuity
    "RelationshipGraph",   # MCP: Character relationship dynamics
]
```

**3. Session Persistence:**

```python
# Each agent maintains session across production
async with ClaudeSDKClient(options=director_options) as director:
    # Session persists across episodes
    # Director remembers prior decisions, style choices, feedback

    # Episode 1 production
    await director.query("Plan opening scene for Episode 1")
    # ... production continues ...

    # Later: Episode 2 production (same session)
    await director.query("Episode 2 opening should callback to Episode 1")
    # Director has memory of Episode 1 decisions
```

## Dynamic Autonomy System

### Context-Aware Autonomy Spectrum

Unlike rigid authority boundaries, agents operate along a **dynamic autonomy spectrum** where decision-making authority adapts to context. The same agent handling the same type of decision may act autonomously in one context, collaboratively in another, or seek approval in a third—all based on contextual assessment.

**Core Principle:** Autonomy is not fixed by role or decision type, but emerges from context evaluation including impact, confidence, risk, dependencies, and learned patterns.

### Hybrid Autonomy Assessment

Each agent uses a **hybrid approach** combining general guidelines with self-assessment:

**1. Baseline Guidelines:**

- Decision types have default autonomy levels (e.g., "shot composition" → autonomous, "visual style change" → collaborative)
- Provides starting point for agent reasoning
- Prevents decision paralysis while allowing flexibility

**2. Contextual Self-Assessment:**

- Agents evaluate current context to escalate or de-escalate from baseline
- Factors considered:
  - **Impact scope**: How many agents/systems affected?
  - **Risk level**: How reversible is this decision?
  - **Confidence**: Sufficient context and expertise?
  - **Dependencies**: Does this require coordination?
  - **Precedent**: Similar decisions made before?
  - **Resources**: Budget or timeline impact?

**3. Adaptive Learning:**

- Track approval/rejection patterns → calibrate confidence
- Learn Orchestrator preferences → personalize autonomy
- Recognize decision patterns → increase autonomy for proven patterns

### Decision Autonomy Levels

**Autonomous Execution:**

- Agent makes decision and acts immediately
- No collaboration or approval required
- Logged for learning and audit trail
- **Example**: Director agent selecting camera angle for routine dialogue scene

**Collaborative Decision:**

- Agent creates plan and shares with relevant peer agents
- Time-boxed debate (typically 5 minutes)
- Consensus → execute; No consensus → escalate
- **Example**: Director and DP negotiating lighting approach for new location

**Approval Required:**

- Agent creates plan with rationale
- Requests approval from appropriate authority (peer agent, leadership agent, or Orchestrator)
- Waits for approval before executing
- **Example**: Director proposing major narrative change affecting character arc

### Decision Intelligence Framework

```python
class AgentDecision:
    """
    Each agent decision includes contextual autonomy assessment.

    Agents don't just make domain decisions (what shot to use, how to light),

### Autonomy Evolution Over Production

The learning system enables agents to progressively increase autonomy as production continues:

**Episode 1: Learning Phase**

- Many decisions escalated to Orchestrator for approval
- Agents learning vision, preferences, style
- High approval request rate (~60-70%)
- Orchestrator provides detailed feedback

**Episode 4-6: Internalization Phase**

- Agents recognize patterns from prior episodes
- Autonomy increases for proven decision types
- Approval request rate drops (~30-40%)
- Collaborative decisions dominate

**Episode 9-12: Autonomous Phase**

- Agents operate mostly autonomously
- Strong pattern recognition and confidence
- Approval requests rare, only for novel situations (~10-15%)
- Agents internalized "What Would Orchestrator Decide"

### Example: Autonomy Evolution in Practice

Tracing Director agent's lighting decisions across Arcadian Summers production:

```python
# EPISODE 1, SCENE 12: First Ethereal World scene

context = DecisionContext(
    decision_type="ethereal_world_lighting",
    is_foundational=True,  # Establishes visual language for series
    reversibility="difficult",  # Would need re-renders
    scope="series"  # Pattern for all Ethereal World scenes
)

# Agent assessment
impact = 0.9        # Foundational for series
confidence = 0.4    # No prior reference
risk = 0.7          # Difficult to change
pattern_match = 0.0 # No similar decisions

# Autonomy level: REQUIRES_APPROVAL (escalated from baseline "collaborative")

# Workflow:
# 1. Director creates plan: "Low-contrast, dreamlike blue/white lighting"
# 2. Initiates debate with DP
# 3. DP proposes: "High-contrast with sharp edges for otherworldliness"
# 4. Time-boxed debate (5 min) → No consensus
# 5. Escalate to Orchestrator with both proposals
# 6. Orchestrator approves DP approach: "Ethereal should feel dangerous"

# Learning logged:
# - Ethereal World lighting → high-impact → requires approval
# - Orchestrator preference: Danger over dreamlike
# - DP's visual judgment aligned with Orchestrator


# EPISODE 5, SCENE 8: Another Ethereal World scene

context = DecisionContext(
    decision_type="ethereal_world_lighting",
    is_foundational=False,  # Pattern established
    reversibility="moderate",
    scope="scene"
)

# Agent assessment with learning
impact = 0.4        # Scene-level, not series-defining
confidence = 0.8    # Clear pattern from prior decisions
risk = 0.4          # Moderate reversibility
pattern_match = 0.95 # Strong match to Episode 1,3,4 decisions

# Autonomy level: AUTONOMOUS (de-escalated from baseline)

# Workflow:
# 1. Director to DP: "Ethereal scene, following high-contrast approach"
# 2. DP: "Agreed, consistent with established style"
# 3. Both execute autonomously
# No approval needed - pattern internalized

# Learning logged:
# - Pattern reinforced: Ethereal World = high-contrast
# - Autonomous execution successful
# - Increased confidence for future similar decisions


# EPISODE 11, SCENE 15: New Ethereal location with unusual properties

context = DecisionContext(
    decision_type="ethereal_world_lighting",
    is_foundational=False,
    reversibility="moderate",
    scope="scene",
    context_notes="This Ethereal location has unique atmospheric properties"
)

# Agent assessment
impact = 0.4
confidence = 0.6    # Pattern exists, but context differs
risk = 0.4
pattern_match = 0.7 # Partial match - similar but not identical

# Autonomy level: COLLABORATIVE (agent recognizes deviation from pattern)

# Workflow:
# 1. Director to DP: "Ethereal scene, but atmospheric anomaly may need adjustment"
# 2. DP: "Agreed, let's collaborate on variant"
# 3. Time-boxed debate: Modify high-contrast approach for atmosphere
# 4. Consensus: High-contrast core + atmospheric haze layer
# 5. Execute agreed variant

# Learning logged:
# - Pattern variant successful
# - Collaborative approach for edge cases validated
# - New pattern: Ethereal + atmosphere = modified high-contrast
```

## Multi-Agent Coordination Patterns

### Pattern 1: Parallel Collaboration

Agents work concurrently on independent tasks:

```python
# Episode production workflow
async def produce_episode(episode_num: int):
    # All agents operate in parallel
    async with ClaudeSDKClient(options=writer_options) as writer, \
               ClaudeSDKClient(options=director_options) as director, \
               ClaudeSDKClient(options=dp_options) as dp, \
               ClaudeSDKClient(options=set_designer_options) as set_designer:

        # Concurrent execution
        tasks = [
            writer.query(f"Refine dialogue for Episode {episode_num} Scene 5"),
            director.query(f"Plan shot list for Episode {episode_num} Scene 3"),
            dp.query(f"Design lighting for Ethereal World scenes"),
            set_designer.query(f"Build virtual environment for Gregorian Settlement")
        ]

        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

        # Agents worked autonomously in parallel
        return results
```

### Pattern 2: Sequential Collaboration

Agents hand off work in production pipeline:

```python
async def scene_production_pipeline(scene_id: str):
    # 1. Writer finalizes script
    async with ClaudeSDKClient(options=writer_options) as writer:
        await writer.query(f"Finalize script for {scene_id}")
        script = get_latest_script(scene_id)

    # 2. Director and DP plan shots (parallel)
    async with ClaudeSDKClient(options=director_options) as director, \
               ClaudeSDKClient(options=dp_options) as dp:
        director_task = director.query(f"Create shot list for {scene_id}")
        dp_task = dp.query(f"Design cinematography for {scene_id}")
        await asyncio.gather(director_task, dp_task)

    # 3. Character agents perform scene
    async with ClaudeSDKClient(options=arcadian_21_options) as arcadian, \
               ClaudeSDKClient(options=living_bible_options) as bible:
        await arcadian.query(f"Perform your lines in {scene_id}")
        await bible.query(f"Perform your lines in {scene_id}")

    # 4. Editor assembles
    async with ClaudeSDKClient(options=editor_options) as editor:
        await editor.query(f"Assemble rough cut of {scene_id}")
```

### Pattern 3: Collaborative Debate

Agents negotiate creative decisions using time-boxed structured debate (see "Time-Boxed Collaborative Debate" in Dynamic Autonomy System section for full implementation):

```python
async def collaborative_decision(decision_prompt: str):
    """
    Multiple agents propose alternatives, debate with time limit,
    and reach consensus or escalate to Orchestrator.

    Uses the dynamic autonomy system's time-boxed debate protocol.
    """

    # Agents propose their perspectives
    async with ClaudeSDKClient(options=director_options) as director, \
               ClaudeSDKClient(options=dp_options) as dp, \
               ClaudeSDKClient(options=writer_options) as writer:

        # Each agent analyzes and proposes
        director_proposal = await director.query(
            f"Propose approach for: {decision_prompt}"
        )
        dp_proposal = await dp.query(
            f"Cinematography perspective on: {decision_prompt}"
        )
        writer_proposal = await writer.query(
            f"Narrative perspective on: {decision_prompt}"
        )

        # Time-boxed collaborative debate (5 minutes)
        debate_result = await time_boxed_debate(
            plan=director_proposal,  # Starting point
            collaborators=[director, dp, writer],
            time_limit=300
        )

        if debate_result.consensus_reached:
            # Consensus achieved - execute agreed plan
            await director.query(f"Execute: {debate_result.agreed_plan}")
        else:
            # No consensus - escalate to Orchestrator
            orchestrator_decision = await orchestrator_review(
                decision_prompt,
                [director_proposal, dp_proposal, writer_proposal],

            await director.query(f"Execute: {orchestrator_decision}")
```

### Pattern 4: Character Agent Interaction

Character agents perform scenes with emotional continuity:

```python
async def perform_scene(scene_id: str, characters: list[str]):
    """
    Character agents interact in-character with persistent memory.
    """

    # Load scene script
    scene = load_scene_script(scene_id)

    # Initialize character agents with session persistence
    character_agents = {}
    for char_name in characters:
        options = get_character_options(char_name)  # Persistent session
        character_agents[char_name] = ClaudeSDKClient(options=options)

    # Character agents perform dialogue
    async with contextlib.AsyncExitStack() as stack:
        agents = {
            name: await stack.enter_async_context(client)
            for name, client in character_agents.items()
        }

        for line in scene.dialogue:
            character = line.character
            dialogue_prompt = f"""
            Scene: {scene.description}
            Your line: "{line.text}"

            Deliver this line in-character, considering:
            - Your emotional state from previous scenes
            - Your relationships with other characters present
            - The scene context and objectives
            """

            performance = await agents[character].query(dialogue_prompt)

            # Performance includes voice synthesis, emotional expression
            # Other character agents observe and react
```

## Shared Production Context

### Centralized Production Database

All agents access shared production knowledge:

```python
# Production context available to all agents
production_context = {
    "series_bible": "Series vision, themes, world-building",
    "script_database": "Version-controlled scripts for all episodes",
    "character_profiles": "Persistent character memory and relationships",
    "style_guide": "Visual/audio aesthetic references",
    "shot_library": "Previously rendered shots and sequences",
    "production_schedule": "Timeline, milestones, deadlines",
    "orchestrator_notes": "Vision clarifications, feedback, approvals"
}

# Implemented as MCP servers
# Each agent accesses via tool calls
async with ClaudeSDKClient(options=agent_options) as agent:
    # Agent queries production context
    await agent.query("Review series bible for thematic guidance")
    # MCP server provides context from shared database
```

### Communication Protocols

**Agent-to-Agent Messaging:**

```python
# Agents communicate via shared message bus (MCP server)
async def agent_message(from_agent: str, to_agent: str, message: str):
    """
    Enable direct agent-to-agent communication for coordination.
    """
    # MCP server stores message
    await mcp_message_bus.send(
        from_agent=from_agent,
        to_agent=to_agent,
        message=message,
        timestamp=datetime.now()
    )

    # Recipient agent retrieves in next query
    # Example: DP to Director
    # "I've completed lighting design for Scene 12. Ready for your review."
```

**Escalation to Orchestrator:**

```python
async def escalate_to_orchestrator(agent_name: str, issue: str, context: dict):
    """
    Agents escalate unresolved conflicts or approval-required decisions.
    """
    escalation = {
        "agent": agent_name,
        "issue": issue,
        "context": context,
        "timestamp": datetime.now(),
        "status": "pending_orchestrator_review"
    }

    # Store in orchestrator dashboard for human review
    await orchestrator_queue.add(escalation)

    # Orchestrator reviews and provides decision
    # Agent receives approval/direction and proceeds
```

## Orchestrator Interaction Layer

### Orchestrator Dashboard

Human Orchestrator monitors and guides via custom interface:

**Dashboard Components:**

1. **Agent Status Monitor**: Real-time view of all agent activity
2. **Production Pipeline View**: Episode progress, milestones, blockers
3. **Approval Queue**: Decisions requiring Orchestrator approval
4. **Agent Communication Log**: Inter-agent messages and debates
5. **Quality Review**: Rendered outputs (shots, scenes, rough cuts)
6. **Vision Control Panel**: Update style guide, constraints, objectives

**Orchestrator Workflow:**

```python
# Orchestrator sets vision at production start
async def initialize_production(series_bible: str, style_guide: str):
    """
    Orchestrator establishes foundational vision for all agents.
    """
    await production_database.store("series_bible", series_bible)
    await production_database.store("style_guide", style_guide)

    # Brief all agents on vision
    for agent in all_crew_agents:
        await agent.query(f"""
        Production initialization:
        - Review series bible
        - Review style guide
        - Understand your role and collaboration protocols
        - Acknowledge vision and constraints
        """)

# Orchestrator reviews milestone deliverables
async def review_episode_rough_cut(episode_num: int):
    """
    Orchestrator approves or requests revisions.
    """
    rough_cut = await get_episode_rough_cut(episode_num)

    # Human review via dashboard
    orchestrator_feedback = await dashboard.review_and_provide_feedback(rough_cut)

    if orchestrator_feedback.approved:
        # Proceed to final production
        await finalize_episode(episode_num)
    else:
        # Send revision notes to relevant agents
        await editor_agent.query(f"Revisions needed: {orchestrator_feedback.notes}")
        await director_agent.query(f"Director notes: {orchestrator_feedback.notes}")
```

## Observability and Monitoring

### Sentry Integration for Agent Tracing

Monitor agent decisions and collaboration patterns:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.anthropic import AnthropicIntegration

# Initialize Sentry for production monitoring
sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="your-sentry-dsn",
    integrations=[AnthropicIntegration(include_prompts=True)],
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
    environment="arcadian_summers_production"
)

# Track agent workflows
async def tracked_agent_query(agent_name: str, query: str):
    """
    Wrap agent queries with Sentry tracing for observability.
    """
    with sentry_sdk.start_transaction(
        op="agent.query",
        name=f"{agent_name} Query"
    ) as transaction:

        transaction.set_tag("agent", agent_name)
        transaction.set_tag("episode", current_episode)

        async with ClaudeSDKClient(options=get_agent_options(agent_name)) as agent:
            with sentry_sdk.start_span(op="llm.query", description=query):
                response = await agent.query(query)

            # Track tool usage
            for message in agent.receive_response():
                if message.type == "tool_use":
                    with sentry_sdk.start_span(
                        op="tool.call",
                        description=message.tool_name
                    ):
                        pass  # Tool execution tracked

        return response
```

### Production Metrics

Key metrics for Orchestrator monitoring:

- **Agent Activity**: Query volume, tool usage per agent
- **Collaboration Patterns**: Inter-agent message frequency
- **Approval Cycles**: Time to Orchestrator review
- **Production Velocity**: Scenes completed per time period
- **Quality Metrics**: Revision cycles, approval rates
- **Resource Usage**: Compute, API costs, rendering time

## Memory and Persistence Architecture

### Character Agent Memory System

Character agents maintain continuity across episodes:

```python
# Character memory implemented as MCP server with vector database
class CharacterMemoryMCP:
    """
    Persistent episodic memory for character agents.
    """

    def __init__(self, character_name: str):
        self.character = character_name
        self.vector_db = VectorDatabase(f"memory_{character_name}")

    async def store_scene_memory(self, episode: int, scene: str, memory: dict):
        """
        Store character's experience of a scene.
        """
        await self.vector_db.insert({
            "episode": episode,
            "scene": scene,
            "timestamp": datetime.now(),
            "emotional_state": memory["emotional_state"],
            "events": memory["events"],
            "relationships": memory["relationships"],
            "internal_thoughts": memory["internal_thoughts"]
        })

    async def retrieve_relevant_memories(self, context: str) -> list:
        """
        Retrieve memories relevant to current scene context.
        """
        # Vector search for contextually relevant memories

    async def get_emotional_continuity(self) -> dict:
        """
        Track emotional state evolution across episodes.
        """

# Character agent uses memory in performance
async def character_performance_with_memory(character_name: str, scene_context: str):
    """

    """
    memory_mcp = CharacterMemoryMCP(character_name)
    relevant_memories = await memory_mcp.retrieve_relevant_memories(scene_context)

    character_options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
        system_prompt=f"""

    )

    async with ClaudeSDKClient(options=character_options) as character:
        performance = await character.query(f"Perform scene: {scene_context}")

        # Store this scene's memory for future continuity
        await memory_mcp.store_scene_memory(
            episode=current_episode,
            scene=scene_context,
            memory=extract_memory_from_performance(performance)
        )
```

### Production State Persistence

Save and resume production across sessions:

```python
# Production state serialization
async def save_production_state(episode: int):
    """
    Serialize all agent states for resumption.
    """
    production_state = {
        "episode": episode,

        "agent_sessions": {},
        "production_context": {},
        "approval_queue": []
    }

    # Save each agent's session ID
    for agent_name, agent_client in active_agents.items():
        production_state["agent_sessions"][agent_name] = agent_client.session_id

    # Save production context
    production_state["production_context"] = {
        "current_scene": current_scene,
        "completed_scenes": completed_scenes,
        "pending_approvals": pending_approvals
    }

    await storage.save("production_state.json", production_state)

async def resume_production(state_file: str):
    """
    Resume production from saved state.
    """
    state = await storage.load(state_file)

    # Restore agent sessions
    for agent_name, session_id in state["agent_sessions"].items():
        agent_options = get_agent_options(agent_name)
        agent_options.resume = session_id  # Resume from saved session

        active_agents[agent_name] = ClaudeSDKClient(options=agent_options)

    # Restore production context
    current_scene = state["production_context"]["current_scene"]
    completed_scenes = state["production_context"]["completed_scenes"]

    # Continue production
    await continue_episode_production(state["episode"])
```

        await revise_episode("ep01", orchestrator_final_approval.notes)
```

## Scaling Considerations

### Production for 12-Episode Season

**Timeline Management:**

- Episode production can overlap (Writer on Ep 3 while Editor assembles Ep 1)
- Character memory accumulates across episodes
- Agent sessions persist across entire season
- Orchestrator reviews milestones asynchronously

**Resource Optimization:**

- Parallel agent execution maximizes throughput
- Shared production context minimizes redundant context
- MCP servers cache frequently accessed data
- GPU allocation for rendering tasks

**Quality Consistency:**

- Style guide enforced across all agents and episodes
- Character agents maintain emotional continuity
- Director/DP collaboration ensures visual coherence
- Orchestrator gates ensure alignment with vision

## Future Extensions

### Cross-Production Persistence

Character agents retain identity across multiple productions:

```python
# Arcadian Summers Season 2
# Character agents resume with accumulated Season 1 memories

async def season_2_production():
    # Same character agents, extended memory
    arcadian_options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
        session_id="arcadian_21_s02",  # New season, persistent character
        # Agent has access to all Season 1 memories via CharacterMemory MCP
    )

    async with ClaudeSDKClient(options=arcadian_options) as arcadian:
        await arcadian.query("You've grown since Season 1. How has your experience changed you?")
        # Agent responds with continuity from 12-episode Season 1 arc
```

### Agent Learning and Adaptation

Crew agents improve through production experience:

- Recognizing successful creative patterns (e.g., effective lighting for emotional scenes)
- Adapting to Orchestrator's preferences and feedback style
- Refining collaboration protocols with peer agents
- Building domain expertise across productions

## System Summary: Dynamic Autonomy in Practice

The **agentic crew implementation** combines three key innovations:

### 1. Context-Aware Autonomy

Every decision includes contextual assessment—agents don't follow rigid rules but evaluate impact, confidence, risk, dependencies, and learned patterns to determine whether to act autonomously, collaborate, or seek approval. The same agent making the same type of decision will adapt autonomy level based on context.

### 2. Structured Collaboration

Time-boxed debate protocols enable efficient multi-agent collaboration without endless deliberation. Agents propose, discuss, refine, and either reach consensus (5-minute cycle) or escalate to higher authority. This balances creative exploration with production efficiency.

### 3. Adaptive Learning

Agents track decision patterns, approval rates, and Orchestrator preferences to progressively increase autonomy over production. Episode 1 requires heavy oversight as agents learn vision; by Episode 12, agents operate mostly autonomously, internalizing "What Would Orchestrator Decide."

### Integration with Three-Layer Architecture

**Orchestrator Layer:**

- Sets vision and style guidelines (baseline autonomy rules)
- Reviews approval requests from agents
- Provides feedback that agents learn from
- Monitors production via dashboard showing agent autonomy patterns

**Agent Coordination Layer:**

- Each agent has `AgentDecision` and `AgentLearningSystem` components
- Agents self-assess autonomy for every decision
- Time-boxed debates happen peer-to-peer within this layer
- Learning systems share pattern libraries across related agents

**Production Tools Layer:**

- MCP servers provide decision logging and pattern storage
- Character Memory MCP tracks agent learning history
- Production Database MCP stores approval workflows and feedback

### Key Metrics for Orchestrator

The learning system enables tracking:

- **Autonomy distribution**: % decisions autonomous vs. collaborative vs. approval-required
- **Approval rates**: Success rate by autonomy level and decision type
- **Debate efficiency**: Consensus rate and average debate duration
- **Pattern recognition**: Agents' confidence growth over episodes
- **Orchestrator workload**: Approval requests trending down as agents learn

**Expected trajectory** (Arcadian Summers 12-episode season):

- **Episodes 1-3**: 60-70% approval requests, agents learning
- **Episodes 4-8**: 30-40% approval requests, pattern internalization
- **Episodes 9-12**: 10-15% approval requests, autonomous operation

This architecture enables true **collaborative co-creation** where agents progressively earn autonomy through demonstrated alignment with Orchestrator's vision, while maintaining supreme human authority and the ability to intervene at any granularity.
