# MCP Security

Comprehensive security framework for MCP emphasizing user consent, least privilege, and transparent data handling.

## Security Philosophy

MCP implements a comprehensive security model that emphasizes **user consent and control** throughout all interactions[2]. The protocol requires explicit user consent before any data access or tool execution occurs, ensuring that users maintain full awareness and control over AI actions[2].

### Core Security Principles

**1. User Consent First**
- Explicit approval required for all operations
- Users see what data will be accessed
- Users approve tool executions before they occur
- No silent data transmission[2]

**2. Transparency**
- Clear disclosure of data access patterns
- Visible tool parameters and effects
- Audit trails for all operations
- No hidden behaviors

**3. Least Privilege**
- Minimal necessary permissions
- Scoped server access
- Granular authorization controls
- Defense in depth[3]

**4. Data Privacy**
- User data never shared without consent
- No unauthorized transmission
- Privacy-preserving designs
- Clear data handling policies[2]

## Authentication Mechanisms

MCP supports multiple authentication methods to accommodate different deployment scenarios and security requirements[6][15].

### API Key Authentication

**Use case:** Simple authentication for trusted environments

**Implementation:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-server": {
      "command": "mcp-server",
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Best practices:**
- Store API keys in environment variables
- Never commit keys to source control
- Rotate keys regularly
- Use different keys per environment

### OAuth Flows

**Use case:** Third-party service integration with delegated access

**Supported flows:**
- Authorization Code flow (most secure)
- Client Credentials flow (service-to-service)
- Device Code flow (limited input devices)

**Benefits:**
- User controls permissions
- Time-limited access tokens
- Revocable access
- Standard protocol

**Implementation considerations:**
- Handle token refresh
- Store tokens securely
- Clear tokens on logout
- Validate token scopes

### Environment Variable Credentials

**Use case:** Local development and system service authentication

**Example configuration:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "database-server": {
      "command": "mcp-db-server",
      "env": {
        "DB_HOST": "${DB_HOST}",
        "DB_USER": "${DB_USER}",
        "DB_PASSWORD": "${DB_PASSWORD}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Security considerations:**
- Use system environment variables
- Never log credential values
- Restrict environment variable access
- Consider using secret management services

### Enterprise Authentication

**Use case:** Enterprise deployments with existing identity infrastructure

**Supported methods:**
- SAML integration
- Active Directory/LDAP
- SSO providers
- Custom authentication connectors[15]

**Integration points:**
- Microsoft Copilot Studio connector framework[15]
- Custom authentication handlers
- Identity provider integration
- Role-based access control

## Authorization Model

### User-Based Authorization

**Host-level control:**
- User explicitly authorizes server connections
- User approves resource access requests
- User consents to tool executions
- User can revoke access at any time[2]

**Implementation:**
```text
User Request → Host → Consent Dialog → User Approval → Server Execution
```

### Server-Level Authorization

**Scope limitation:**
Each server should have limited scope[3]:
- Access only necessary resources
- Expose only required tools
- No cross-server permissions
- Minimal blast radius

**Example scoped servers:**
```text
file-server → Only access ~/Documents folder
email-server → Only send email, no inbox access
db-server → Only read from specific tables
```

### Resource-Level Authorization

**Granular permissions:**
- Individual resource access control
- User-specific resource filtering
- Dynamic permission evaluation
- Context-aware authorization

**Example:**
```json
{
  "resource": "db://customers/records",
  "permissions": {
    "read": ["user:john@example.com", "role:sales"],
    "filter": "region = user.region"
  }
}
```

### Tool-Level Authorization

**Execution control:**
- Per-tool permission requirements
- Parameter validation and sanitization
- Side effect disclosure
- Approval workflows for dangerous operations

**Example dangerous tools:**
```text
delete_database_record → Require explicit confirmation
send_mass_email → Show recipient count, require approval
execute_system_command → Restricted or disabled by default
```

## Data Privacy and Protection

### User Consent Requirements

**Before accessing user data:**
1. **Disclose what data** will be accessed
2. **Explain why** data access is needed
3. **Show where** data will be sent
4. **Obtain explicit approval** from user
5. **Log consent** for audit purposes[2]

**Example consent flow:**
```text
AI: "I need to access your calendar to schedule this meeting."
Host: [Shows consent dialog]
      "Allow access to Calendar?"
      - Events: Read access
      - Destination: calendar-server (localhost)
User: [Approves or Denies]
```

### Data Transmission Controls

**Host responsibilities:**
- Prevent unauthorized data transmission
- Verify server identity before sending data
- Encrypt data in transit
- Log all data access[2]

**Server responsibilities:**
- Only request necessary data
- Specify data usage clearly
- Implement data minimization
- Support data deletion requests

### Privacy-Preserving Patterns

**Data filtering:**
```text
Instead of: "Send entire user database to server"
Do: "Send only fields needed: name, email (filter out SSN, payment info)"
```

**Local processing:**
```text
Instead of: "Send documents to cloud for analysis"
Do: "Process documents locally via stdio transport"
```

**Aggregation:**
```text
Instead of: "Access individual transaction records"
Do: "Access pre-aggregated summary statistics"
```

## Access Control Implementation

### Least Privilege Principle

**Deploy narrowly scoped servers:**[3]

**Bad: Monolithic server**
```text
company-server
  - Full database access
  - All file system access
  - Email sending
  - Calendar management
  - CRM access
```

**Good: Focused servers**
```text
customer-db-server → Read-only access to customer table
email-server → Only send, no inbox access
calendar-server → Current user's calendar only
crm-server → Read-only sales data
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduced attack surface
- Easier security auditing
- Clearer permission boundaries
- Simplified compliance

### Permission Scoping

**Resource scoping:**
```json
{
  "server": "file-server",
  "allowed_paths": [
    "~/Documents/Projects/",
    "~/Documents/Work/"
  ],
  "denied_paths": [
    "~/.ssh/",
    "~/Documents/Personal/"
  ]
}
```

**Tool scoping:**
```json
{
  "server": "database-server",
  "allowed_operations": ["read", "query"],
  "denied_operations": ["write", "delete", "admin"],
  "rate_limit": {
    "queries_per_minute": 10
  }
}
```

### Multi-Layer Security

**Defense in depth:**

1. **Host-level:** User authorization
2. **Transport-level:** Encrypted connections
3. **Server-level:** Authentication and scope limits
4. **Resource-level:** Per-resource permissions
5. **Tool-level:** Parameter validation and approval
6. **Audit-level:** Comprehensive logging

## Enterprise Security Integration

### Virtual Network Integration

For enterprise deployments:[15]

**Network isolation:**
- Servers deployed within corporate VNet
- No public internet exposure
- Firewall rules enforced
- Private endpoints for services

**Benefits:**
- Compliance with network policies
- Integration with existing security infrastructure
- Controlled data flow
- Reduced attack surface

### Data Loss Prevention (DLP)

**DLP integration:**[15]
- Scan data before transmission
- Block sensitive data patterns (SSN, credit cards)
- Alert on policy violations
- Enforce data handling policies

**Implementation:**
```text
User Data → DLP Scanner → Policy Check → [Allow/Block] → MCP Server
```

### Audit and Compliance

**Comprehensive logging:**
- All authentication attempts
- Resource access patterns
- Tool executions and parameters
- User consent decisions
- Errors and security events

**Log data:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-04-11T10:30:00Z",
  "user": "john@example.com",
  "action": "tool_execution",
  "server": "email-server",
  "tool": "send_email",
  "parameters": {
    "to": "customer@example.com",
    "subject": "Re: Support request"
  },
  "result": "success",
  "consent": "granted"
}
```

**Compliance support:**
- GDPR compliance (consent, data access, deletion)
- SOC 2 requirements (audit trails, access controls)
- HIPAA compliance (PHI protection)
- Industry-specific regulations
