# Knowledge Capture Workflow

Explores the conceptual and philosophical foundations of transforming external information signals (links, papers, videos) into integrated knowledge within an agentic Zettelkasten system, examining levels of detail, temporal dimensions, and the distinction between information hoarding versus cognitive capacity expansion.

## The Fundamental Question

This isn't just about "saving links" - it's about **navigating the gap between external information and internalized knowledge**.

### What's Really Happening

When someone sends you a link, you're receiving:

- **A pointer** to someone else's thinking
- **A potential insight** that might connect to your work
- **A signal** from your network about what they think is relevant to you
- **An interruption** to your current cognitive flow

The deeper question: **What transforms this external artifact into knowledge you can actually use?**

## Knowledge Representation Levels (LoD)

Knowledge exists in distinct **representation states** as it transforms from external signals to integrated understanding:

### Level 0: Raw Signal

- External content in original form (URL, article, video, paper)
- Zero processing beyond basic metadata (source, date, who sent it)
- **Value**: Preserves the fact that this existed and someone flagged it
- **Cost**: Contributes nothing to understanding

### Level 1: Extracted Content

- Selected passages, claims, or data points from source
- Still in original author's framing and language
- May be compressed (highlighted, bolded) but remains external
- **Value**: Separates signal from noise without requiring synthesis
- **Cost**: Still someone else's thinking, not yet internalized

### Level 2: Synthesized Knowledge

- Internalized understanding in your own mental model
- Expressed in your voice, connected to your existing knowledge
- Answers "how does this change what I think?"
- **Value**: Now it's YOUR knowledge, not just stored information
- **Cost**: Requires cognitive work, cannot be automated

### Level 3: Integrated Context

- Positioned within knowledge graph with typed relationships
- Bidirectional links to prerequisites, related concepts, examples
- Available as composable context for LLM-augmented tasks
- **Value**: Maximum utility - becomes substrate for thinking
- **Cost**: Highest effort, only justified for foundational concepts

## Workflow Operations

These **actions** transform knowledge between representation levels:

### Triage

- **Operation**: Decide whether to engage with external signal
- **Decision**: Process now, defer, or discard
- **Input**: Level 0 (Raw Signal)
- **Output**: Decision to proceed or skip
- **Factors**: Relevance, novelty, timing, sender intent

### Capture

- **Operation**: Extract relevant content from source
- **Transforms**: Level 0 → Level 1
- **Methods**: Copy passages, take notes, excerpt key points
- **Goal**: Separate signal from packaging

### Compress

- **Operation**: Progressive highlighting/summarization within extracted content
- **Stays at**: Level 1 (still external framing)
- **Methods**: Bold important passages, highlight critical insights
- **Goal**: Optimize for future scanning and retrieval

### Synthesize

- **Operation**: Internalize and express in your own understanding
- **Transforms**: Level 1 → Level 2
- **Methods**: Rewrite in your voice, connect to mental models, identify implications
- **Goal**: Make it YOUR knowledge

### Integrate

- **Operation**: Connect to knowledge graph with relationships
- **Transforms**: Level 2 → Level 3
- **Methods**: Add wikilinks, establish typed relationships, position in MOCs
- **Goal**: Make knowledge discoverable and composable

## The Temporal Dimension

Knowledge processing also has a *time* dimension:

### Immediate Applicability

- "I need this context right now for a current project"
- Justifies immediate processing to Level 3-4
- High confidence about relevance

### Deferred Applicability

- "This might be useful later, but I'm not sure when/how"
- Warrants Level 0-1 capture, process later when context becomes clear
- Relevance is speculative

### Opportunistic Discovery

- "I wasn't looking for this, but it sparks an unexpected connection"
- Serendipity - can't be planned, only enabled
- Requires a browsable archive that surfaces latent connections

## The Philosophical Core

What we're really trying to achieve isn't **information hoarding** but **cognitive capacity expansion**.

The question isn't "How do I save everything I encounter?" but rather:

> "How do I build a system where the right knowledge surfaces at the right time to augment my thinking on a specific task?"

This reframes the problem:

- **Not**: "Capture everything, organize perfectly"
- **But**: "Create pathways between external signals and active cognition"

The knowledge graph isn't an archive - it's **cognitive infrastructure** that makes your past learning available to your future thinking (and to LLMs augmenting that thinking).

## Key Insights (Emerging)

1. **Progressive refinement is essential** - you can't know on first encounter what Level of Detail is appropriate
2. **The sender's intent matters** - are they signaling "FYI" or "this changes things"?
3. **Context determines value** - the same link has different value at different points in your work
4. **Synthesis, not storage** - raw content dump is an anti-pattern
5. **LLM-readiness is the test** - will this be useful context when attached to a future prompt?

## Open Questions

- How do we handle **progressive refinement** in practice? (Level 1 → Level 3 over time)
- What's the right **backlog size** before Tier 2 becomes noise?
- How do we capture **who sent it and why** as relationship metadata?
- What role does **forgetting** play? (Not everything needs to be remembered)
- How do **emergent patterns** surface from accumulated signals?
