# Agents - Map of Content

This MOC connects all notes related to AI agents, agentic workflows, and agent architecture patterns.

## Core Concepts

- [[agents]] - AI agents powered by LLMs/LRMs/SLMs for autonomous, goal-directed action
- [[agentic_development_context]] - Comprehensive development ecosystems for AI-augmented teams with shared context, configurations, and knowledge
- [[semantic_routing]] - Intelligent model selection based on query semantics for optimal LLM routing
- [[react_agent_pattern]] - Design pattern for building AI agents using React as the UI framework
- [[llm_self_talk_optimization]] - Token-efficient prompting technique for LLM-to-LLM communication in multi-agent systems

## Coding Assistants

- [[claude_code]] - Anthropic's agentic AI coding assistant with native terminal operations and multi-agent workflows
- [[claude_code_agents]] - Subagent system in Claude Code for parallel task execution with isolated contexts
- [[claude_code_plugins]] - Extensibility system for Claude Code via slash commands, subagents, MCP servers, and hooks
- [[claude_code_hooks]] - Lifecycle event system for injecting deterministic automation at specific workflow stages
- [[claude_code_efficiency_optimization]] - Performance optimization techniques for Claude Code including search strategies, LLM routing, and cost-effective workflows
- [[claude_code_internals]] - Reverse-engineered architecture and implementation details for recreating Claude Code's agentic loop, tools, and memory systems
- [[zettelkasten_claude_plugin]] - Implementation guide for building a knowledge graph plugin for Claude Code

## Integration & APIs

- [[agent_mcp_apis]] - Comprehensive reference for MCP APIs designed for agent tool integration
- [[adding_mcp_to_claude_code]] - Step-by-step guide for adding custom agents to Claude Code

## Related Topics
