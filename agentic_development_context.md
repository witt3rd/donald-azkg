# Agentic Development Context (ADC)

An **Agentic Development Context** (also called Contextual Development Environment or CDE) is a comprehensive, version-controlled development ecosystem that extends beyond traditional environment standardization to include shared context, documentation, AI agent configurations, team knowledge, and persistent state—enabling AI-augmented development teams to operate with unified, context-rich workspaces.

## Evolution of Development Environments

### From Isolation to Context Sharing

**Virtual Environments** (Python venv, Node modules):
- Standardized dependency isolation at language/runtime level
- Individual developer scope with consistent package versions
- Prevents conflicts between projects
- Limited to technical dependencies, no shared knowledge

**Containerization** (Docker, Kubernetes):
- OS/process-level isolation and standardization
- Infrastructure portability and deployment consistency
- Team-wide environment consistency
- Static assets and procedural initialization only
- No memory of decisions or evolving context

**Agentic Development Contexts**:
- Extends standardization to include shared contextual knowledge
- Live documentation, agent configurations, and team state
- Dynamically updated by both humans and AI agents
- Persistent memory across sessions and team members
- Context-aware AI assistance with full project understanding

## Core Components

### Technical Infrastructure

- Dependency manifests and lock files
- Build scripts and CI/CD configurations
- Infrastructure as code definitions

**Development Toolchains**:
- Linters, formatters, and code quality tools
- Test runners and coverage analyzers
- Build systems and deployment platforms
- IDE configurations and extensions

### Contextual Layer

### Constitution Layer

Drawing from spec-driven development approaches, ADCs define fundamental principles:
- Architectural principles and design constraints
- Team practices and decision-making processes
- Business constraints and compliance requirements
- Quality gates and acceptance criteria
- Code of conduct and collaboration standards

### Deployment and Synchronization

**One-Command Setup**:
```bash
adc install project-name
```
Instantly configures:
- All development tools and dependencies
- AI agent configurations and MCP servers
- Documentation and shared knowledge
- Project context and team state

**Version Control Integration**:
- ADC configurations versioned alongside code
- Context evolves with project over time
- Rollback capabilities for environment and context
- Branch-specific context variations

**Team Synchronization**:
- Shared through team repositories
- Automatic updates for all team members
- Consistent experience across developers
- Context drift prevention
