# Graph Note

Show detailed information about a specific note, including all relationships and backlinks.

## Task

Display:
- Note title, tags, and summary (from YAML frontmatter and heading)
- All relationships from "Related Concepts" section
- Backlinks (other notes that reference this note)

## Input

User provides filename: `/graph-note agents.md` or `/graph-note agents`

## Execution Steps

### 1. Normalize Filename

Ensure filename has `.md` extension.

### 2. Verify Note Exists

Use Glob to check if note exists:
```bash
Glob "agents.md"
```

If not found, report error.

### 3. Read Note Content

Use Read tool to get full note content.

### 4. Extract Metadata

From the note content:
- **Title**: First `# Heading` after YAML frontmatter
- **Tags**: From `tags:` field in YAML frontmatter
- **Summary**: First paragraph after title (before `##` sections)

### 5. Parse "Related Concepts" Section

From note content, extract all relationships:
- Prerequisites
- Related Topics
- Extends
- Extended By
- Alternatives
- Examples

For each relationship, capture the target note and "why" explanation.

### 6. Find Backlinks

Use Grep to find all notes that reference this note:
```bash
# Find all wikilinks to this note
Grep "\[\[agents\]\]" --glob="*.md" --output_mode="files_with_matches"
```

Count and list the files that link to this note.

```

## Use Cases

- **Understand connections**: See how a note fits into the knowledge graph
- **Find usage**: See where a concept is referenced (backlinks)
- **Verify relationships**: Check if relationships are accurate and complete
- **Discover gaps**: Find missing prerequisite or extension relationships

## Tools Used

- **Glob** - Verify note exists
- **Read** - Get full note content
- **Grep** - Find backlinks (wikilinks to this note)
- **Parse logic** - Extract YAML, title, summary, relationships

## Present Results

- Show clear breakdown of relationship types
- Highlight if note has no prerequisites (might be foundational)
- Highlight if note has many Extended By (indicates it's a base concept)
- Show backlink count to indicate note importance/usage
- Suggest using `/expand-graph` if relationship count seems low
