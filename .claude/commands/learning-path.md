# Learning Path

You are tasked with generating an optimal learning sequence for a target note by tracing prerequisite chains through the knowledge graph.

## 1. Parse Input

**Input format:** User provides:
- A note name: `/learning-path mcp_security.md`
- Or just the topic: `/learning-path mcp_security`

**Normalize input:**
- Add `.md` extension if missing
- Verify the target note exists
- If not found, suggest similar notes using Glob

## 2. Load Knowledge Graph

**Read `knowledge_graph_full.json`**

**Extract the target note's data:**
```json
{
  "notes": {
    "target_note.md": {
      "relationships": {
        "prerequisites": [...],
        "related_concepts": [...],
        "extends": [...],
        ...
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 3. Trace Prerequisite Chains

**Algorithm: Depth-First Traversal**

Starting from the target note, recursively follow prerequisite relationships:

```
function buildPrerequisiteTree(note, visited = new Set()):
  if note in visited:
    return []  // Cycle detection

  visited.add(note)

  prerequisites = graph[note].relationships.prerequisites

  if prerequisites is empty:
    return [note]  // Foundation reached

  tree = []
  for prereq in prerequisites:
    subtree = buildPrerequisiteTree(prereq.note, visited)
    tree.extend(subtree)

  tree.append(note)
  return tree
```

**Key features:**
- **Cycle detection:** Track visited nodes to prevent infinite loops
- **Multiple paths:** Handle notes with multiple prerequisites
- **Foundation detection:** Identify notes with no prerequisites
- **Depth tracking:** Calculate how many levels deep each note is

## 4. Build Learning Sequence

**Create ordered learning path:**

1. **Topological sort:** Order notes so prerequisites always come before dependents
2. **Remove duplicates:** Each note appears once, at earliest possible position
3. **Group by depth level:** Show conceptual layers

**Example structure:**
```
Level 0 (Foundations):
- note_a.md
- note_b.md

Level 1 (Builds on foundations):
- note_c.md (requires: note_a)
- note_d.md (requires: note_b)

Level 2 (Intermediate):
- note_e.md (requires: note_c, note_d)

Level 3 (Target):
- target_note.md (requires: note_e)
```

## 5. Read Note Summaries

**For each note in the learning path:**
- Use Read tool to get first 3-5 lines (the summary)
- Extract the brief description after the title
- This provides context for each step

**Example:**
```
## mcp_overview.md
"Introduction to Model Context Protocol, a standardized way for AI assistants to connect to data sources and tools."
```

## 6. Analyze Learning Path

**Calculate metrics:**

**Path statistics:**
- Total notes in sequence: `N`
- Depth levels: `M` (foundation to target)
- Estimated reading time: `N × 10 minutes = X minutes`
- Foundational notes: Count of level 0 notes
- Branching factor: Average prerequisites per note

**Complexity assessment:**
- **Simple path (1-3 notes):** "Quick learning path"
- **Moderate path (4-7 notes):** "Intermediate learning sequence"
- **Complex path (8+ notes):** "Comprehensive learning journey"

**Identify critical concepts:**
- Notes that multiple paths converge through
- "Bottleneck" concepts that are prerequisites for many others

## 7. Suggest Related Learning

**Enrich the path with optional content:**

**Parallel reading (related_concepts):**
- Notes at same level that provide additional context
- Not strictly required but enhance understanding

**Deeper dives (extended_by):**
- Advanced topics that build on concepts in the path
- "After mastering this path, explore..."

**Alternative approaches (alternatives):**
- Different ways to achieve similar understanding
- "For a different perspective, consider..."

**Practical examples (examples):**
- Concrete implementations to solidify understanding
- "Apply these concepts with..."
