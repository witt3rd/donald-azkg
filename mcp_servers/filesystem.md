# Understanding MCP Filesystem Server Path Behavior

Based on my research into the **Anthropic Model Context Protocol (MCP) filesystem server**, your observation is **absolutely correct**. The MCP filesystem server's path handling exhibits specific behavior that can be confusing and problematic, particularly on Windows systems.

## The Core Issue

The MCP filesystem server does **not** treat paths as relative to the base directory you specify during initialization. Instead, it enforces **strict path validation** where all paths must be **absolute paths** that fall within the configured allowed directories[^1][^2].

### Path Validation Behavior

When you initialize the MCP filesystem server with a base directory like `c:/foo/bar`, the server:

1. **Stores the base directory as an allowed directory** for security purposes[^3][^4]
2. **Requires all subsequent tool calls to use absolute paths** that are contained within this allowed directory[^1][^2]
3. **Rejects relative paths like "."** because they don't match the absolute path validation logic[^1]

### Specific Problems on Windows

The research reveals several critical issues, particularly on Windows systems[^1]:

**Case Sensitivity Issues**: The server has problems with drive letter casing. If you configure it with a lowercase drive letter (e.g., `c:/foo/bar`), but the internal validation expects uppercase (`C:/foo/bar`), paths may be rejected even when they should be valid[^1].

**Path Outside Allowed Directories Error**: The server frequently reports that paths are "outside allowed directories" even when they are clearly subdirectories of the configured base path. This happens due to flawed path validation logic[^1].

**Inconsistent Tool Behavior**: Different MCP tools within the same server exhibit inconsistent path validation. For example, `find_by_name` might work while `read_file` and `list_directory` fail for the same paths[^1].

## Working Solutions and Workarounds

Several MCP filesystem server implementations address this issue differently:

### Relative Path Support

Some MCP filesystem servers **do support relative paths** by using the current working directory (CWD) approach[^5][^6]:

- The server determines its project root from its own Current Working Directory at launch[^5]
- All operations are confined to this project root directory[^5]
- The server uses **relative paths from the project root**[^5]
- The MCP host must set the `cwd` to the intended project directory when launching the server[^5]


### Session-Based Path Management

Other implementations provide session-aware path management[^7][^8]:

- A `set_filesystem_default` tool that sets a default absolute path for the current session[^7]
- Relative paths in subsequent tool calls are resolved against this default[^7]
- This provides more flexible path handling while maintaining security[^7]


## Recommendations

Given these findings, here are your options:

### For the Standard Anthropic Server

1. **Use absolute paths**: Always provide full absolute paths that include the base directory
2. **Ensure consistent casing**: On Windows, use uppercase drive letters consistently
3. **Validate path format**: Use double backslashes in JSON configuration on Windows (`"C:\\\\foo\\\\bar"`)

### Alternative Implementations

Consider using alternative MCP filesystem servers that better support relative paths[^5][^6]:

- Servers that use the current working directory approach
- Implementations with session-based path management
- Servers specifically designed for project-relative operations

Your experience highlights a significant usability issue with the standard Anthropic MCP filesystem server's path handling, particularly the expectation that paths should be relative to the configured base directory when they actually need to be absolute paths within that directory.
