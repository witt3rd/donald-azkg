# Unquantified Claims Checker Process

1. **Identify Unquantified Claims**
   - Scan the document for broad, general statements without supporting evidence.
   - Flag claims using absolute language: "most," "all," "never," "always," "the majority of."
   - Note claims about trends, goals, or behaviors without specific data or examples.
   - *Examples:* "Most AI frameworks aim to amplify intelligence," "Developers always struggle with X," "The industry has moved toward Y."

2. **Assess Claim Importance**
   - Determine if the claim is central to the argument or a supporting detail.
   - Consider: Does this claim need to be precise for the argument to work?
   - Evaluate: Would the argument collapse if this claim were challenged?
   - *Critical claims:* Those that form the foundation of key arguments.
   - *Supporting claims:* Those that provide context but aren't essential.

3. **Evaluate Evidence Requirements**
   - For critical claims: Require specific evidence, examples, or qualified language.
   - For supporting claims: Consider if general knowledge or observation suffices.
   - Check audience expectations: Technical/academic vs. general discussion.
   - Assess: Can this be reasonably accepted as common knowledge in the field?

4. **Apply Appropriate Treatment**
   - **Add Qualifiers:** Transform absolute statements to nuanced ones.
     - "Most frameworks" → "Many frameworks" or "Common frameworks"
     - "Always fails" → "Often fails" or "Typically fails"
   - **Provide Context:** Add scope limitations or acknowledgment of uncertainty.
     - "Based on current trends..." or "In my observation..."
   - **Add Examples:** Support broad claims with specific instances when critical.
   - **Signal Uncertainty:** Use language that indicates the claim's basis.
     - "It appears that..." or "Evidence suggests..."

5. **Document Decisions**
   - Record which claims were modified and why.
   - Note claims accepted as reasonable general knowledge.
   - Flag claims that need future research or verification.
   - Maintain consistency in treatment across similar claim types.

## Quick Decision Framework

**Keep as-is if:**
- Widely accepted in the field
- Not central to the argument
- Audience expects general statements
- Qualification would disrupt flow unnecessarily

**Modify if:**
- Central to key arguments
- Could mislead readers
- Makes absolute claims about complex topics
- Technical audience expects precision

**Research if:**
- Critical to credibility
- Controversial or disputed
- Specific data would strengthen the point
- Reader likely to question the claim
