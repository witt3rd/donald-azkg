# Claude Code Plugins: Extensibility Architecture

**Claude Code plugins** are modular extension packages that enhance and customize Claude Code's capabilities through four core extension points: slash commands, subagents, MCP servers, and hooks. Plugins enable developers to integrate external tools, automate workflows, and tailor the development environment to specific team needs.

## Plugin Architecture

### Four Extension Types

**Slash Commands**: User-defined shortcuts for recurring tasks registered as command handlers
- Custom workflow triggers (e.g., `/review`, `/document`, `/deploy`)
- Execute complex multi-step operations with single command
- Can invoke agents, run scripts, or trigger external integrations

**Subagents**: Specialized agent modules focused on specific development tasks
- Run in isolated sandboxes with dedicated context
- Receive prompts and project context from main agent
- Handle domain-specific operations (testing, documentation, optimization)

**MCP Servers**: Bridges to external data and services using Model Context Protocol
- Standardized integration with third-party tools (Jira, GitHub, databases)
- RESTful endpoints with JSON schema validation
- Permission controls and authentication management

**Hooks**: Custom logic injected at specific workflow lifecycle events
- Pre-commit validation and formatting
- Post-generation testing and quality checks
- Event-driven automation triggers

## How Plugins Work

### Plugin Package Structure
```
my-plugin/
├── manifest.json          # Extension point declarations
├── commands/             # Slash command implementations
├── agents/               # Subagent definitions
├── mcp-servers/          # MCP server endpoints
└── hooks/                # Lifecycle event handlers
```

### Execution Model
- **Isolation**: Plugins run in sandboxed environments for security
- **API Interface**: Defined APIs for each extension point
- **Context Passing**: Claude Code provides project context and state
- **Result Handling**: Plugins return structured responses to main agent

## Creating Plugins

### Development Workflow

1. **Define Extension Points**: Create manifest specifying commands, agents, servers, or hooks
2. **Implement Handlers**: Write logic in supported languages (TypeScript, Python)
3. **Test Locally**: Use Claude Code development mode
4. **Package**: Bundle manifest and implementation files
5. **Publish**: Share via GitHub or internal repositories

### API/SDK Support

**Anthropic provides official SDKs** for plugin development:
- Slash command handler registration API
- Subagent definition interfaces with sandbox execution
- MCP server scaffolding tools
- Hook lifecycle event APIs

### Example Plugin Structure

```typescript
// manifest.json
{
  "name": "review-assistant",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "extensions": {
    "commands": ["review"],
    "agents": ["code-reviewer"],
    "hooks": ["pre-commit"]
  }
}
```

## Installation and Management

### Installation Methods

**Command-Line Installation**:
```bash
/plugin install review-assistant
```

**Project-Level Configuration**:
```json
// .claude/settings.json
{
  "plugins": [
    "review-assistant",
    "jira-integration",
    "auto-doc"
  ]
}
```

### Plugin Management
- Enable/disable on demand for focused environments
- Centralized team management via configuration
- Automatic updates from trusted repositories
- Version control and compatibility checking

## MCP Integration

### Model Context Protocol Role
MCP serves as the primary protocol for external service integration in plugins:
- **Standardized Communication**: REST/JSON endpoints with schema validation
- **Authentication**: OAuth, API keys, or service tokens
- **Context Exchange**: Bidirectional data flow between Claude Code and external tools
- **Reliability**: Error handling, retries, and connection management

### MCP Server Plugin Pattern
```typescript
// MCP server endpoint
POST /mcp/jira/create-issue
{
  "title": "Bug: Authentication failure",
  "project": "MYPROJ",
  "type": "bug"
}
```

## Common Use Cases

**Development Workflow Automation**:
- Custom code review with quality checks
- Automated test generation and execution
- Documentation generation and synchronization

**External Tool Integration**:
- Project management (Jira, Linear, Asana)
- Version control operations (GitHub, GitLab)
- Cloud services (AWS, GCP, Azure APIs)

**Quality Enforcement**:
- Pre-commit linting and formatting
- Security scanning and vulnerability checks
- Style guide enforcement

**Team Collaboration**:
- Shared workflow templates
- Standardized code generation patterns
- Custom deployment pipelines

## Plugin Examples

**Review Assistant**:
- `/review` slash command for code critique
- Specialized review agent with best practices knowledge
- Pre-commit hook ensuring tests pass

**Jira Integration**:
- MCP server synchronizing issue updates
- `/ticket` command for creating and linking issues
- Automatic status updates on branch merges

**AutoDoc Generator**:
- Subagent analyzing code for documentation
- `/document` command generating markdown docs
- Hook updating docs on code changes

**LintEnforcer**:
- Hook running linters after code edits
- Auto-fix common issues
- Report remaining violations to user

## Technical Implementation

### Security Model
- Sandboxed execution prevents plugin interference
- Permission system controls file and network access
- Code signing for trusted plugin sources
- Audit logging for plugin actions

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading of plugins on demand
- Caching for MCP server responses
- Async execution for non-blocking operations
- Resource limits per plugin

### Extension API
```typescript
// Slash command handler
export function registerCommand(name: string, handler: CommandHandler) {
  // Register command with Claude Code
}

// Subagent definition
export class ReviewAgent extends Agent {
  async execute(context: AgentContext): Promise<AgentResult> {
    // Agent implementation
  }
}

// Hook registration
export function onPreCommit(handler: HookHandler) {
  // Register pre-commit hook
}
```

## Current State (2025)

**Maturity**: Public beta with rapidly evolving standards and APIs

**Ecosystem**: Growing collection of open-source plugins for common development needs

**Integration**: Seamless support in VS Code extension and desktop applications

**Adoption**: Primary customization method for teams using Claude Code

**Standardization**: Anthropic establishing plugin formats and extension APIs for ecosystem growth

Claude Code plugins represent the platform's extensibility layer, enabling teams to adapt the agentic coding assistant to their specific workflows, tools, and quality requirements through composable, modular extensions.
