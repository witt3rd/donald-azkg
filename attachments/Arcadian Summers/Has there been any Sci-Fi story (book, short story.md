# Has there been any Sci-Fi story (book, short story, TV show, movie) related to the following: "Set in the year 2339, the series follows Correctional Officer Arcadian Summers, who possesses a rare genetic ability to travel through time via "The Ethereal World" to alter pivotal moments in individuals' pasts—creating ripple effects that reshape humanity's future."

Based on my comprehensive search across multiple queries and over 100 web sources covering science fiction literature, television series, films, and related media about time travel, correctional officers, genetic abilities, future settings (including the year 2339), ethereal/parallel dimensions, and characters with the ability to alter past events to reshape the future, I found no existing science fiction work matching your specific description.

## No Direct Match Found

After conducting extensive research through science fiction databases, TV series lists, time travel fiction compilations, prison/correctional officer sci-fi stories, and searches for the specific elements you described, **there does not appear to be any published book, short story, TV show, or movie** featuring:

- A protagonist named **Arcadian Summers** (or any correctional officer with this name)
- A setting specifically in **the year 2339**
- A rare genetic ability to time travel through **"The Ethereal World"**
- The specific premise of a correctional officer altering pivotal moments in individuals' pasts to reshape humanity's future


### Similar Works That Share Elements

While no exact match exists, several science fiction works contain *some* of these elements:

**Time Travel + Law Enforcement:**

- **Continuum** (2012-2016 TV series) - Features police officer Kiera Cameron from 2077 Vancouver sent back to 2012, though she's not a correctional officer and doesn't have genetic abilities[^1]
- **Timecop** (1994) - Features Max Walker, an officer for a time travel regulation agency, but focuses on preventing criminals from changing the past rather than intentionally altering it[^2]
- **Predestination** (2014) - Features a temporal agent on time-travel missions[^3]

**Prison/Correctional Settings + Time Travel:**

- **Hawksbill Station** by Robert Silverberg - Features a penal colony in the Cambrian Period where prisoners are exiled via one-way time travel, though guards don't travel[^4][^5]
- **OtherLife** (2017) - Explores using virtual reality for prison sentences, with time perception manipulation[^6]
- **Time Spike** by Eric Flint - Involves a prison thrown back in time to the age of dinosaurs[^7]

**Genetic/Innate Time Travel Abilities:**

- **There Will Be Time** by Poul Anderson - Features a man born with innate ability to travel in time, but no connection to law enforcement or correction[^8]
- Discussions in science fiction communities about biological/genetic time travel mechanisms[^9]

**Far Future Settings:**
The year 2339 is relatively uncommon as a specific setting. Most sci-fi uses either near-future dates or goes much further (like **Altered Carbon** set in 2384).[^10][^11]

### Conclusion

The specific combination of elements you've described—**a correctional officer named Arcadian Summers in 2339 with genetic time travel abilities through "The Ethereal World" who alters pivotal moments to reshape humanity's future**—appears to be either:

1. **An original concept** not yet published
2. **A very obscure work** not indexed in major sci-fi databases, IMDB, Goodreads, or discussed in science fiction communities
3. **A work in development** or unpublished manuscript
4. **A misremembered combination** of elements from multiple different stories

If you're trying to identify a specific work you encountered, you may want to consider whether some details might differ from what you remember, or whether this concept might have been from a short story in an anthology, a lesser-known web series, or independent publication that hasn't gained wide recognition.
