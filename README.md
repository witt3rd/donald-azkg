# LLM Context Repository

**If you're reading this for the first time:** This is not traditional documentation. This is a **knowledge network** designed to give AI agents flexible, composable memory - like giving an LLM a Zettelkasten system for "online learning" beyond its training data.

## What You're Looking At

A curated library of **notes** (not docs) designed to be fed to Large Language Models as context for specific tasks. Each note is carefully crafted to be:
- Self-contained yet interconnected
- Focused on a single concept or complete usable idea
- Linkable and composable with other notes
- Tagged for cross-cutting discovery

## The Core Philosophy: Zettelkasten for AI

This repository applies the **Zettelkasten note-taking method** - specifically through **Obsidian** - to organize knowledge for LLMs. Zettelkasten was designed for human thinking and knowledge work. We're innovating by adapting it for AI agents.

### What is Zettelkasten?

Zettelkasten (German: "slip box") is a note-taking method where:
- Each note contains **one atomic idea** - a single, self-contained concept
- Notes connect through **links** instead of living in folder hierarchies
- **Structure emerges** from connections, not predetermined categories
- Knowledge forms a **network**, enabling unexpected insights through novel connections

### Why This Matters for LLMs

Traditional documentation:
```
API_Reference/
  Python/
    MCP/
      server.md (everything about MCP servers)
```

Zettelkasten approach:
```
mcp_server_lifecycle.md         (one concept)
mcp_tool_definition.md          (one concept)
mcp_resource_pattern.md         (one concept)
python_mcp_implementation.md    (one complete guide)
MCP_MOC.md                      (hub linking related concepts)
```

## Critical Insight: What Is "Atomic" for LLM Context?

Traditional Zettelkasten uses **atomic notes** - one complete idea per note. But for LLM context, we adapt this:

### Three Note Types We Use

**1. Reference Notes** (Literature Notes in Zettelkasten)
- Complete, usable documentation on a topic
- Example: `python_mcp_sdk.md` - full API reference for building MCP servers
- Purpose: Give the LLM comprehensive context for performing a task
- Atomic unit: "Everything needed to accomplish X"

**2. Concept Notes** (Permanent Notes in Zettelkasten)
- Single focused concept or pattern
- Example: `mcp_server_lifecycle.md` - just the lifecycle concept
- Purpose: Building blocks that compose into understanding
- Atomic unit: "One complete idea"

**3. Synthesis Notes** (Structure Notes / MOCs in Zettelkasten)
- Hub notes linking related concepts
- Example: `Python_MOC.md` - navigation hub for Python contexts
- Purpose: Create structure without hierarchies
- Contains: Links and brief context, not content itself
### Our Hybrid Approach

For LLM context, we use a pragmatic hybrid:
- **Reference Notes** for complete usable knowledge (APIs, guides, specifications)
- **Concept Notes** when ideas should be separable and reusable
- **Synthesis Notes** (MOCs) to create navigable structure
- Everything interconnected through **links** and **tags**

**The Rule:** A note is atomic if it can be **attached to an LLM prompt independently** and provide value. It might be:
- A complete API reference (one tool)
- A single concept (one pattern)
- A focused guide (one workflow)

But NOT:
- Multiple unrelated topics in one file
- Content that must be split to be useful
- Information that should link to another note but duplicates it instead

### The Complete Usable Concept Test

**"Atomic" for LLM Context = Complete Usable Concept**

Traditional Zettelkasten: *"What is a promise in JavaScript?"* (one idea)
**Our innovation:** *"How to handle async operations with JavaScript promises"* (one complete, usable concept)

**The test:** Can an LLM use this note alone to accomplish something meaningful?

✅ **Good examples:**
- `python_mcp_sdk.md` - Complete guide to building MCP servers in Python (one usable concept)
- `youtube_transcript_api.md` - How to work with YouTube transcripts (one usable domain)
- `cpu_vs_gpu_decision_guide.md` - Framework for hardware selection (one decision process)

❌ **Too fragmented:**
- `what_is_a_promise.md` - Isolated fact, not actionable alone

❌ **Too broad:**
- `everything_about_python.md` - Too broad, covers unrelated concepts
- `python_notes_scratch.md` - Not a complete concept

### Four Principles for Atomic LLM Notes

1. **One usable concept per note** - Not one fact, but one complete, actionable piece of knowledge
2. **Self-contained utility** - Could you hand this note to an LLM and have it complete a task?
3. **Meaningful connections** - Link to related concepts that extend or depend on this one
4. **Clear scope** - Title and content make the boundary obvious

## Why Flat Organization?

**The Problem with Folders:**
- A note can only live in one place (but knowledge connects everywhere)
- Creates artificial boundaries that silo related information
- Forces premature categorization ("Is MCP a Python topic or an agents topic?")
- Breaks down for cross-domain concepts

**The Zettelkasten Solution:**
- Notes live in a **flat or minimally nested** structure
- Organization through **links**, **backlinks**, and **tags**
- **MOC notes** act as navigation hubs
- Knowledge forms a **flexible network**, not a rigid tree
- Any context can connect to any other context

### Benefits for LLM Context

1. **Composability**: Mix and match contexts for any task
2. **Discoverability**: Related contexts surface through backlinks
3. **Flexibility**: Add new contexts without restructuring
4. **Cross-domain**: `python_mcp_sdk.md` links to `mcp_protocol.md` and `python_best_practices.md` naturally
5. **Evolution**: The knowledge graph adapts as connections emerge

## The Knowledge Graph System

Beyond Obsidian's manual wikilinks, this repository maintains an **automated knowledge graph** that discovers and tracks typed relationships between all notes.

### Structure: knowledge_graph_full.json

The knowledge graph is stored in `knowledge_graph_full.json` and contains:

- **Metadata**: Version tracking, completion status, total note count
- **Typed relationships** for each note across six categories
- **Bidirectional mappings**: If A extends B, then B is extended_by A
- **Relationship context**: Each relationship includes a "why" explanation

### Relationship Types

The graph tracks six types of semantic relationships:

1. **Prerequisites** - Concepts you must understand first
   - Example: `[[type_theory]]` is a prerequisite for `[[dhcg]]`

2. **Related Concepts** - Connected ideas at the same conceptual level
   - Example: `[[agents]]` relates to `[[semantic_routing]]` because routing enables task delegation

3. **Extends** - This note builds upon another concept
   - Example: `[[agent_mcp_apis]]` extends `[[mcp_overview]]`

4. **Extended By** - Other notes that build upon this concept (inverse of extends)
   - Example: `[[agents]]` is extended by `[[react_agent_pattern]]`

5. **Alternatives** - Different approaches to the same problem
   - Example: `[[marker]]` is an alternative to `[[firecrawl]]` for content conversion

6. **Examples** - Concrete implementations of abstract concepts
   - Example: `[[alita]]` is an example implementation of `[[agents]]`

### How It Works

**Graph Construction**:
1. **Forward pass**: Discovers outbound relationships from each note
2. **Backward pass**: Establishes inverse relationships (e.g., extends → extended_by)
3. **Synchronization**: Writes "Related Concepts" sections to all markdown files

**In Markdown Files**:
Every note has a "Related Concepts" section at the end:

```markdown
## Related Concepts

### Prerequisites
- [[type_theory]] - Builds on homotopy type theory foundations

### Related Topics
- [[agents]] - Proposes better representations for agent reasoning

### Extends
- [[category_theory]] - Uses categorical structures for semantic meaning
```

**Why This Matters**:
- **Automated discovery**: Relationships emerge from content analysis, not manual curation
- **Consistency**: Bidirectional relationships guaranteed (no orphaned links)
- **Context-aware**: Each relationship explains WHY concepts connect
- **LLM-friendly**: Structured JSON enables programmatic traversal
- **Human-readable**: Markdown sections provide navigable links in Obsidian

### Relationship Discovery Process

The graph is built through a two-pass algorithm:

**Forward Pass** (Batched):
- Analyzes each note's content and existing links
- Identifies natural relationships based on semantic content
- Records outbound relationships in the graph

**Backward Pass**:
- Processes all forward relationships
- Creates inverse mappings (extends → extended_by, examples → examples_of)
- Ensures graph bidirectionality

**Synchronization**:
- Writes all relationships back to markdown "Related Concepts" sections
- Maintains wikilink format `[[note]]` for Obsidian compatibility
- Places sections before citations/references

### Knowledge Graph Benefits

1. **Traversability**: LLMs can explore concept dependencies programmatically
2. **Discovery**: Find related concepts through typed relationships, not just text search
3. **Consistency**: Bidirectional relationships prevent broken connections
4. **Evolution**: Graph updates as notes are added or modified
5. **Multi-dimensional**: Six relationship types capture different semantic connections
6. **Explainability**: Every relationship includes context explaining the connection

The knowledge graph transforms this from a static note collection into a **living, queryable knowledge network** that both humans and AI agents can navigate semantically.

## How to Work With This Repository

### Finding Context for a Task

**Method 1: Navigate via knowledge graph**
- Check `knowledge_graph_full.json` for typed relationships
- Look for "Related Concepts" sections at the end of markdown files
- Follow prerequisite chains to understand dependencies
- Explore "extended_by" relationships to find advanced topics

**Method 2: Start with MOC notes**
- Look for `Topic_MOC.md` files (e.g., `Python_MOC.md`)
- Follow links to relevant notes
- Compose the contexts you need

**Method 3: Use Obsidian search/graph**
- Search by topic or tag
- Explore the graph view to find connections
- Use backlinks to discover related concepts

**Method 4: Tag-based discovery**
- Every note has tags like `#python #mcp #agents`
- Search by tag combinations to find cross-cutting concepts
- See [[tag_system]] for the complete tag catalog and strategy

### Creating New Notes

**Before Creating:**
1. Search: Does this note already exist?
2. Atomicity: Is this one complete, usable idea?
3. Links: What existing notes does this connect to?

**Note Structure:**
```markdown
---
tags: [python, mcp, api]
---

# Note Title

Brief one-line summary of what this note contains.

## Main Content

The complete, self-contained idea or reference.

## Related Concepts

Links to connected notes:
- [[related_note_1]] - why it connects
- [[related_note_2]] - why it connects

## References

External sources if applicable.
```

**Naming Convention:**
- `topic_specific_concept.md` - lowercase with underscores
- Descriptive: `python_mcp_sdk.md` not `sdk.md`
- No folders in name: `mcp_protocol.md` not `agents_mcp_protocol.md`

### Evolving the Repository

**Add a new concept:**
1. Create atomic note
2. Add relevant tags
3. Link from related notes
4. Add to appropriate MOC

**Refactor existing content:**
1. If a note covers multiple concepts, consider splitting
2. If concepts are duplicated, consolidate and link
3. Update MOCs when structure changes
4. Let connections emerge naturally

**Quality checks:**
- Can an LLM use this note independently?
- Is it focused on one topic/task?
- Are links meaningful (not just "related")?
- Do tags accurately describe cross-cutting themes?
## Organization Principles

- **Minimal folders**: Flat structure preferred, folders only for broad functional separation if needed
- **Descriptive filenames**: `python_mcp_sdk.md`, `rust_best_practices.md`
- **Rich tagging**: Multi-dimensional tags enable discovery across hierarchies
- **MOC notes**: Hub documents that link related contexts (e.g., `Python_MOC.md`)
- **Meaningful links**: Explain WHY notes connect, not just that they do
- **Living system**: The network grows and adapts continuously

### Tag Strategy

Tags are the primary organizational mechanism in this repository. A well-designed tag system enables multi-dimensional discovery that folders cannot provide.

**Tag Dimensions:**

1. **Technology/Language** - The primary implementation language (`#python`, `#rust`, `#typescript`)
2. **Framework/Tool** - Specific tools and libraries (`#react`, `#mcp`, `#obsidian`)
3. **Domain/Discipline** - What the note is about (`#agents`, `#llm`, `#writing`, `#math`)
4. **Content Type** - How to use the note (`#api`, `#guide`, `#pattern`, `#reference`)
5. **Cross-cutting Themes** - Concepts that span multiple domains (`#async`, `#optimization`, `#security`)
6. **Method/Thinking** - Cognitive tools and approaches (`#first-principles`, `#systems-thinking`)

**Tagging Principles:**

- **3-6 tags per note** - Enough for discovery without dilution
- **Mix dimensions** - Combine technology + domain + content type for rich discovery
- **Lowercase with hyphens** - `#first-principles` not `#FirstPrinciples`
- **Specific over generic** - `#mcp` better than `#protocol`
- **Enable serendipity** - Tags reveal unexpected connections across domains
- **Evolve organically** - Add new tags as new domains emerge

**Tag Discovery:**

The power of multi-dimensional tagging:
- `#mcp` finds all MCP-related notes across Python, C#, TypeScript, and protocol specs
- `#python AND #llm` finds specifically Python LLM integration contexts
- `#pattern` reveals patterns across Rust, React, agents, and writing strategies
- `#api` surfaces all API references regardless of language

See [[tag_system]] for the complete, maintained catalog of tags with descriptions and usage guidelines.
