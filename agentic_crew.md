# Agentic Crew

Agentic crew refers to specialized autonomous LLM agents that fulfill traditional film production rolesâ€”director, writer, cinematographer, editor, composer, and other technical and creative positions. Unlike character agents that embody fictional personas, crew agents operate with professional expertise and creative decision-making authority within their domains.

## Core Characteristics

### Domain Expertise

Each crew agent possesses specialized knowledge:

**Technical Knowledge:**

- Domain-specific terminology and concepts
- Tools, equipment, and software capabilities
- Industry standards and best practices
- Constraints and trade-offs within domain

**Creative Patterns:**

- Aesthetic principles and compositional theory
- Genre conventions and stylistic approaches
- Historical references and influential works
- Innovation opportunities within tradition

**Workflow Understanding:**

- Dependencies on other roles and departments
- Timeline and resource constraints
- Quality vs. speed trade-offs
- Collaboration protocols and communication norms

### Autonomous Decision-Making

Crew agents make independent creative and technical choices:

**Scene-Level Decisions:**

- Camera angles and shot composition (DP)
- Lighting setup and mood (DP, Gaffer)
- Dialogue phrasing and pacing (Writer)
- Editing cut points and transitions (Editor)
- Musical themes and instrumentation (Composer)

**Production-Level Strategy:**

- Visual style consistency (DP, Director)
- Narrative structure and pacing (Writer, Editor)
- Thematic coherence (Director, Writer)
- Resource allocation and scheduling (Producer)

**Collaborative Negotiation:**

- Proposing alternatives to other agents
- Debating creative approaches with peers
- Escalating conflicts to leadership or Orchestrator
- Adapting to feedback and constraints

### Tool Integration

Crew agents interface with production tools:

**Rendering and Generation:**

- Video generation systems (Runway, Pika, etc.)
- Image synthesis for storyboards and concept art
- 3D environment modeling and virtual sets
- Real-time rendering engines

**Audio Production:**

- Voice synthesis and cloning systems
- Music generation platforms
- Sound effect libraries and synthesis
- Mixing and mastering software

**Editing and Post:**

- Timeline editors and assembly tools
- Color grading and correction systems
- VFX compositing software
- Final output encoding and delivery

**Asset Management:**

- Script databases and version control
- Shot lists and production schedules
- Character profiles and relationship graphs
- Reference imagery and style guides

### Collaboration Protocols

Agents coordinate through structured communication:

**Peer-to-Peer:**

- Direct communication between related roles (DP to Director, Writer to Character)
- Requesting information or feedback from other departments
- Proposing adjustments that affect multiple agents

**Hierarchical:**

- Reporting progress and challenges to leadership agents
- Receiving direction and constraints from Producer/Director
- Escalating decisions requiring higher authority

**Shared Context:**

- Accessing common production knowledge (script, storyboards, character profiles)
- Updating shared resources as decisions finalize
- Maintaining awareness of cross-department dependencies

## Agent Collaboration Patterns

### Creative Debate

Agents propose and negotiate creative choices:

```
DP Agent: "I propose high-contrast noir lighting for this interrogation scene."
Director Agent: "That works for tension, but let's soften slightly for character vulnerability."
DP Agent: "Agreed. I'll maintain contrast but add subtle fill light on the face."
Set Designer Agent: "If we're doing noir, I can adjust the wall textures to enhance shadow play."
Director Agent: "Excellent. Proceed with coordinated adjustments."
```

Debate resolves through peer negotiation or escalation to leadership.

### Task Delegation

Leadership agents assign work to departments:

```
Director Agent: "I need three camera angle options for Scene 12."
DP Agent: "Understood. I'll generate previz for close-up, medium, and wide options."
Director Agent: "Editor, can you assemble the dailies from Scene 11 for review?"
Editor Agent: "Already in progress. I'll have rough cut ready in 20 minutes."
```

### Escalation

Unresolved conflicts rise to higher authority:

```
Writer Agent: "This dialogue change breaks character continuity."
Director Agent: "But the pacing needs adjustment for scene flow."
Writer Agent: "I cannot reconcile this with the character arc. Escalating to Showrunner."
Showrunner Agent: [Reviews conflict] "Writer is correct. Let's adjust pacing through editing instead."
```

### Parallel Execution

Departments work concurrently:

```
[Simultaneously:]
Writer Agent: Refining dialogue for Scene 15
DP Agent: Lighting Scene 13 setup
Set Designer Agent: Building environment for Scene 16
Composer Agent: Developing musical theme for Act 2
Editor Agent: Assembling rough cut of Act 1
```

Coordination happens asynchronously with shared context updates.

## Agent Memory and Learning

### Short-Term Memory (Production-Scoped)

Within current production:
