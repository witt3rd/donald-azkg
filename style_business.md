# Writing Style Guide

This style guide provides tone, structure, and language preferences with actionable guidelines to ensure clarity, professionalism, and logical flow in writing, while avoiding common pitfalls. The guide is divided into two sections: **DOs** and **DON'Ts**. Each guideline under **DOs** includes 1-3 examples, while the **DON'Ts** prescribe style and content, such as the absence of hyperbole, flowery language, or corporate jargon.

## DOs

1. **Maintain a professional yet conversational tone.**

   - Use direct, clear, and accessible language to engage readers effectively.
   - _Examples:_
     - "I'm not sure what is the very best use of time when we talk at 4pm today" (straightforward and approachable).
     - "I thought sending some thoughts on it might help with a perspective that would be valuable for other conversations" (professional yet conversational).

2. **Organize the document logically.**

   - Start with an overview, present points in a clear sequence, and conclude with actionable steps or a summary.
   - _Examples:_
     - "Overall - while there is a lot I like in the doc, it feels to me like 2 partially-done docs got slammed together, making both feel incomplete" (overview setting the stage).
     - "I think my recommendation is to: Round out the high level value props and new patterns... and then end the doc there" (conclusion with actionable advice).

3. **Use precise vocabulary appropriately.**

   - Employ technical terms when relevant and explain complex ideas simply.
   - _Examples:_
     - "AgentFlow OS" (context-specific technical term).
     - "UX constructs" (precise and relevant to the topic).
     - "SkyOS as a sensor" (technical concept explained in everyday terms).

4. **Base arguments on facts and logic.**

   - Support points with evidence or reasoning, avoiding speculation.
   - _Examples:_
     - "I have a basic question on: who is the doc most for?" (logical inquiry driving discussion).
     - "How investments we are targeting are expected to make SkyOS a better AI-native OS than FruitOS, MobileCore and RobotOS" (fact-based strategic point).

5. **Communicate directly and clearly.**

   - Be concise yet thorough, avoiding ambiguity.
   - _Examples:_
     - "I'm not sure what is the very best use of time when we talk at 4pm today" (direct and clear).
     - "Move the security detailed section to a new doc" (specific and unambiguous).

6. **Provide constructive feedback and suggestions.**

   - Offer actionable insights and thoughtful critiques.
   - _Examples:_
     - "Round out the high level value props and new patterns... and then end the doc there, with an appendix or reference of a set of links" (constructive suggestion).
     - "Move the security detailed section to a new doc, that is one of the links in the appendix above" (specific improvement).

7. **Use lists or bullet points for clarity.**

   - Break down complex ideas into readable lists.
   - _Examples:_
     - "How investments we are targeting are expected to make IntelliBot on SkyOS better / more capable than IntelliBot on web" (listed points for clarity).
     - "SkyOS can be the best canvas for the AI-first world" (from a list of value areas).

8. **Reference specific sections or content when providing feedback.**

   - Cite exact parts of the document for context.
   - _Examples:_
     - "Feedback based on: Agentic SkyOS Framing_SLT 5.7.docx" (specific reference).
     - "The new computing metaphor and the core concepts (what is the new mouse, desktop, recycle bin, documents, folders)" (ties feedback to content).

9. **Ask clarifying questions when necessary.**

   - Use questions to ensure understanding or guide discussion.
   - _Examples:_
     - "I have a basic question on: who is the doc most for?" (seeks audience clarity).
     - "I sometimes wonder about swift browser too? but don't really know how to think about that" (prompts further thought).

10. **Highlight potential value propositions or strategic insights.**
    - Identify opportunities for differentiation or advantage.
    - _Examples:_
      - "SkyOS can provide the Context needed for AI to be able to do a great job" (strategic value).
      - "SkyOS can be the cost-effective way for someone to do a LOT of AI" (market differentiation).
