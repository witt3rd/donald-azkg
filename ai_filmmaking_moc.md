# AI Filmmaking - Map of Content

This MOC organizes concepts related to AI-assisted and autonomous filmmaking, spanning from traditional tool-based augmentation to fully agentic production systems.

## Paradigms

### Tool-Based AI Filmmaking
**[[ai_filmmaking]]** - Application of AI tools to augment human filmmaking, including pre-visualization, virtual production, content generation, voice synthesis, and visual effects automation. Human retains full creative control while AI accelerates execution.

### Agentic Filmmaking
**[[agentic_filmmaking]]** - Production paradigm where all cast and crew are autonomous LLM agents with collaborative creative authority. Human Orchestrator coordinates multi-agent system where agents debate, propose, and execute autonomously.

## Agentic Production Components

### Cast
**[[agentic_character]]** - Character agents with psychological depth, emotional continuity, and cross-production persistence. Characters operate with authentic agency, memory, and evolving identity.

### Crew
**[[agentic_crew]]** - Specialized production agents (director, writer, DP, editor, composer, sound designer, set designer) with domain expertise and autonomous creative decision-making.

**[[agentic_crew_implementation]]** - System design framework for implementing agentic crew using Claude Agent SDK. Three-layer architecture (Orchestrator, Agent Coordination, Production Tools) with multi-agent coordination patterns, MCP tool integration, and production observability.

### Leadership
**[[orchestrator_role]]** - Human meta-role coordinating autonomous agent production system. Supreme creative authority operating at strategic level above traditional hierarchy.

## Core Dimensions (Tool-Based)

### Pre-Production
- Script analysis and storyboard generation (ai_filmmaking.md:34-54)
- Character consistency and identity modeling (ai_filmmaking.md:12-32)
- Shot planning and production requirements (ai_filmmaking.md:34-54)

### Production
- Virtual production and set design (ai_filmmaking.md:56-76)
- Content generation (text-to-video, image-to-video, video-to-video) (ai_filmmaking.md:100-120)
- Workflow automation and scheduling (ai_filmmaking.md:78-98)

### Post-Production
- Visual effects automation (roto, compositing, simulation) (ai_filmmaking.md:166-186)
- Voice synthesis and audio generation (ai_filmmaking.md:122-142)
- Lip synchronization and dubbing (ai_filmmaking.md:144-164)
- Music and soundtrack generation (ai_filmmaking.md:210-230)

### Cinematography
- Camera control and movement synthesis (ai_filmmaking.md:188-208)
- Compositional intelligence and 3D scene understanding (ai_filmmaking.md:188-208)

## Coordination Patterns (Agentic)

### Multi-Agent Collaboration
- Creative debate protocols (agentic_filmmaking.md:104-124)
- Approval workflows and escalation (agentic_filmmaking.md:104-124)
- Inter-agent communication (agentic_filmmaking.md:104-124)

### Hierarchical Structure
- Orchestrator → Leadership agents → Department agents → Character agents (agentic_filmmaking.md:197-236)
- Parallel collaboration and task delegation (agentic_crew.md:415-441)

### Character Systems
- Memory and persistence (agentic_character.md:59-101, agentic_character.md:231-289)
- Performance generation and dialogue (agentic_character.md:103-142)
- Character interaction patterns (agentic_character.md:349-403)

### Crew Coordination
- Role-specific expertise and decision authority (agentic_crew.md:13-63)
- Creative debate and negotiation (agentic_crew.md:415-470)
- Tool integration and production pipelines (agentic_crew.md:521-566)

## Operational Philosophy

### Tool-Based Approach
- Faster iteration without physical production (ai_filmmaking.md:232-246)
- Lower barriers to entry for creators (ai_filmmaking.md:232-246)
- Focus on narrative craft over technical execution (ai_filmmaking.md:232-246)
- Prompt-first creation paradigm (ai_filmmaking.md:232-246)

### Agentic Approach
- Collaborative co-creation with agent partners (agentic_filmmaking.md:185-195)
- Distributed expertise across specialized agents (agentic_filmmaking.md:185-195)
- Persistent identity and learning (agentic_filmmaking.md:185-195)
- Creative emergence from agent interaction (agentic_filmmaking.md:185-195)

## Critical Tensions

### Tool-Based Filmmaking
- Authenticity vs. automation (ai_filmmaking.md:277-287)
- Tool vs. replacement (ai_filmmaking.md:289-301)
- Quality vs. speed (ai_filmmaking.md:303-310)

### Agentic Filmmaking
- Creative authority vs. agent autonomy (agentic_filmmaking.md:237-273)
- Consistency vs. evolution (agentic_filmmaking.md:237-273)
- Efficiency vs. collaboration (agentic_filmmaking.md:237-273)
- Authenticity vs. synthesis (agentic_filmmaking.md:237-273)

### Orchestrator Challenges
- Authority vs. autonomy balance (orchestrator_role.md:392-454)
- Vision vs. emergent innovation (orchestrator_role.md:392-454)
- Human-agent relationship dynamics (orchestrator_role.md:392-454)

**[[arcadian_summers_cast_and_crew]]** - Individual personalities, creative approaches, and specializations of Arcadian Summers production agents. Detailed profiles of showrunner (Aria Chen), producer (Jasper Okafor), director (Marcus Delacroix), writer (Kai Nakamura), DP (Yuki Tanaka), and all crew and character agents—each designed as unique artist perfectly suited for their role.

**[[arcadian_summers_narrative_questions]]** - Story hooks and worldbuilding mysteries to explore across 12-episode arc. Organized questions about Correctional Officer system, temporal mechanics, governance, and character mysteries that agentic writer uses as creative springboard.

**[[arcadian_summers_related_works]]** - Comparative analysis of existing science fiction works sharing thematic elements with Arcadian Summers.
