# Semantic Routing for LLM Inference

Semantic routing models in LLM inference serving systems use lightweight neural classifiers, semantic embeddings, and task-type detection to classify incoming requests and route them efficiently to the most appropriate model instance—whether SLM (Small Language Model), SRM (Small Reasoning Model), LLM (Large Language Model), or LRM (Large Reasoning Model)—based on estimated complexity, domain, and reasoning requirements.

## Key Techniques and Models

### 1. Semantic Classification with Lightweight Classifiers (BERT-based)

- **ModernBERT or similar small transformer models** encode the incoming prompt or request
- The classifier predicts the **intent**, **domain**, and **complexity** of the input
- **vLLM Semantic Router** uses fine-tuned BERT/ModernBERT to direct:
  - Lightweight queries → SLMs or SRMs
  - Complex, reasoning-heavy queries → LLMs or LRMs

### 2. Semantic Embedding Comparison

- Router converts request into **vector embedding** using BERT-derived model
- Embedding compared to pre-defined **task vectors** or **domain clusters**:
  - Math
  - Creative writing
  - Reasoning tasks
  - Domain-specific (legal, medical, financial)
- Once classified, router selects model specializing in that task/domain

### 3. Mixture-of-Models Framework

- Router acts as **Mixture-of-Models orchestrator**
- Balances between models of different sizes and capabilities based on classifier output
- **Benefits**:
  - Reduces latency by routing simple queries to SLMs
  - Reduces cost by reserving expensive LLMs/LRMs for complex tasks
  - Optimizes throughput and resource utilization

### 4. Semantic Caching

- If request is **semantically similar** to a previous one, response fetched from cache
- Further optimizes throughput and resource use
- Reduces redundant expensive model invocations

### 5. Integration with Cloud-Native Infrastructure

- Systems like **vLLM Semantic Router** and **LLM Semantic Router** integrate into:
  - Kubernetes
  - Envoy (using ExtProc API extension points)
- Intercepts and classifies requests during API traffic flow
- Enables seamless routing without client code changes

## Common Routing Schemes

| Model Type | Task Example | Classification Criteria | Use Case |
|------------|--------------|------------------------|----------|
| **SLM** | Simple Q&A, fast lookup, formatting | "Simple intent", no reasoning, short context | High-frequency, low-complexity operations |
| **SRM** | Basic math/logic, factual queries, simple code | Reasoning needed but short chains, restricted scope | Structured tasks with clear solutions |
| **LLM** | Long-form generation, creative writing, summarization | Domain-specific (creative, summarization), complex language | Content creation, synthesis |
| **LRM** | Deep reasoning, multi-step logic, complex planning | High-complexity, requires Chain-of-Thought, multi-step decomposition | Agentic planning, sophisticated problem-solving |

## Configuration and Extensibility

Routing is **configurable and extensible**:
- Fine-tuned classifiers can be adapted for **custom domains**:
  - Legal
  - Medical
  - Financial
  - Engineering
- Bespoke task types for specific use cases
- Improves both efficiency and domain-specific accuracy

## Emerging Approaches

- **LLM-based meta-routers**: Fast LLM acts as pre-filter or decision-maker for routing
  - Slower than static classifiers unless combined with embedding-based candidate pruning
  - Provides more sophisticated routing logic for edge cases

## Windows Agent Semantic Routing

For the Windows Agent, semantic routing is critical for:

1. **Task-Based Routing**:
   - Simple system configuration → Local SLM
   - Batch file processing → Local SLM with specialized models (OCR, entity recognition)
   - Complex research synthesis → Cloud LLM
   - Multi-step reasoning/planning → Cloud LRM or local SRM (Phi-4)

2. **Privacy-Aware Routing**:
   - Sensitive data (PHI, PII, financial) → Always local models
   - Non-sensitive complex tasks → Cloud models if better quality/capability

3. **Cost Optimization**:
   - High-frequency operations (file operations, simple transformations) → Local SLM
   - Occasional sophisticated reasoning → Cloud LRM

4. **Domain-Specific Routing**:
   - OCR/document understanding → Vision models (local or cloud based on privacy)
   - Code generation → Specialized coding models
   - Structural engineering calculations → Domain-specific engineering model or human expert

## Implementation Considerations

### Classifier Training
- Train on representative set of user requests across complexity spectrum
- Label data with appropriate model tier (SLM, SRM, LLM, LRM)
- Fine-tune BERT-based classifier on this dataset

### Routing Decision Factors
1. **Complexity**: Token length, reasoning depth required
2. **Domain**: Math, creative, technical, domain-specific
3. **Privacy**: Sensitive data → local constraint
4. **Latency**: Real-time interactive vs background batch
5. **Cost**: User/IT budget constraints

### Fallback Strategy
- If routed model fails or unavailable → fallback to next tier
- Track routing accuracy and model performance
- Continuous learning: Update routing based on success/failure patterns
